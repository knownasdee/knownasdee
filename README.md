# Hey there!

I’m a software engineer and product designer who loves meaningful challenges.
I started out in robotics, but moved towards full-stack development over the years.

💻 I have over a decade of experience building web apps, data-driven tools, and design systems — mostly with React, TypeScript, and Node.js.  
🎨 I love the product side of things, clean architecture, and enjoy working at the intersection of technology and creativity.  

🌿 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring nature, practicing pole dance, and raising two beautiful humans.
