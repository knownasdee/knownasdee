# Hi folks 👋

I’m a **software developer** who loves turning complex ideas into simple, meaningful products.  
I started out in **robotics**, stayed for the craft of building things that work *and* make sense.

💻 Over a decade of experience building **web applications**, **data-driven tools**, and **design systems** — mostly with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**.  
🎨 Passionate about clean architecture, intuitive interfaces, and the intersection of **technology and creativity**.  

🌿 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring nature, practicing pole dance, and raising two beautiful humans.
