# Hey there!

I’m a **software engineer** and **product designer** who loves turning complex ideas into simple, meaningful products.  
I started out in **robotics**, but moved towards full-stack development over the years.

💻 I have over a decade of experience building **web applications**, **data-driven tools**, and **design systems** — mostly with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js**.  
🎨 I'm passionate about clean architecture, intuitive interfaces, and the intersection of **technology and creativity**.  

🌿 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring nature, practicing pole dance, and raising two beautiful humans.
